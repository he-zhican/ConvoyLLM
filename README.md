# ConvoyLLM: Dynamic Multi-Lane Convoy Control Using LLMs

## [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17529)
This is the official implementation of the paper ConvoyLLM: Dynamic Multi-Lane Convoy Control Using LLMs.

## Introduction
we introduce LLMs into multi-lane convoy control for the first time to enhance the convoy's adaptive capabilities and cooperation in complex scenarios. The main role of the LLM is to provide effective decision-making support for each vehicle in the convoy through efficient reasoning and generation capabilities. At the same time, we integrate a staggered formation control strategy based on locally dynamic distributed graphs, ensuring that the convoy maintains formation while exhibiting both flexibility and stability.
